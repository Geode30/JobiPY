# JobiPY

## Project Overview

The Job Portal App is a web application designed to connect job seekers with employers. Users can browse through job postings, apply for jobs, and employers can post new job opportunities. This app aims to streamline the job search process and make it easier for both job seekers and employers to find suitable matches.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Distinctiveness

Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms or social networking sites, the Job Portal App serves a unique purpose: to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers. It is distinct from commerce-focused applications, which are designed for buying and selling products, and from networking apps, which focus on connecting individuals and sharing life updates. The core functionality of the Job Portal App revolves around job recruitment and application, making it a specialized tool in the job market ecosystem.

### Complexity

The complexity of this project surpasses that of typical e-commerce and networking apps due to several factors:

1. **Data Management**: The app handles diverse types of data, including user information, job preferences, and resumes (uploaded as PDF files). Managing and securely storing this data requires robust backend architecture and database design.
   
2. **File Storage**: Implementing file storage for resumes introduces additional complexity. Handling file uploads and ensuring their security and accessibility were not covered in the course, adding a layer of complexity.

3. **Real-Time Features**: The most complex feature of this application is its real-time messaging and notification system. Utilizing WebSockets for real-time communication presents challenges, particularly as this is the first time implementing such a feature. Real-time updates for messaging and notifications require careful handling of WebSocket connections and state management.
